The <head> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. It contains high-level information about the site and should only be displayed once to contain the thoughts of the page. The <body> should also only be displayed once per page with either a structureal or semantic markup used. This is the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer.
Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements like headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. These elements will help to guide the user and provide information about the type of document. Semantic markup us used to reinforce the meaning of the document. The semantic markup may be used to place an emphasis on a word, bold, link to definitions or to create citations or quotations. 
For this assignment I first throught of a recipe that I enjoyed and got started on visual Studio Code. Nagivating around this software finally clicked with me and I enjoyed being creative with this assignment. I was stumped when it was time to add a hyper link, but I went back through my notes and worked through it. I enjoyed creating this page for one of my favorite pasta dishes!
