        Delicious Feta Cheese & Tomato Pasta
    </h1>
<h1>
    Ingredients:
</h1>
    <ul>
    <li> Around a tablespoon of olive or rapeseed oil</li>
    <li>3-4 stems of fresh thyme, rosemary or marjoram</li> 
    <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li> ½–1 fresh red chilli, thinly sliced, or a pinch of red chilli flakes</li>
    <li>450g (1lb) cherry tomatoes</li> 
    <li>200g (7 oz) best-quality Feta (keep some back to crumble raw at the end)</li>
    <li>350-450g (12-16oz) dried wholegrain pasta shape of your choice</li>
    <li> a couple pinches of arugula </li>
    <li>½ to 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>  
    <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Directions:
</h1>
<ol>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 400 <sup>o</sup> F.</li>
    <li>Tumble the tomatoes, whole, into a Pyrex or ceramic roasting pan – around 20cm square.</li>
    <li>Squish the cloves of garlic, unpeeled with the side of your knife and add those to the tomatoes along with the herbs and the sliced chili.</li>
    <li>Break about 10% off the top of the block of feta and set aside. Lay the bigger piece, left whole, in the tray so that the cheese is touching the bottom of the pan and the tomatoes and garlic are surrounding it (we’ll keep that 10% bit back to crumble, raw, over the finished pasta).</li>
    <li>Poke half the stems of herbs under the cheese and the rest on top before drizzling the olive oil over everything. Grind black pepper and scatter around a teaspoon of sea salt over everything then give the pan a shake.</li>
    <li>Put it in the oven for around 30-40 minutes, check after 30 minutes and take out of the oven when the tomatoes are soft and golden and the cheese is golden too. Discard the herb stems and squish the garlic out of its skins then discard the skins.</li>
    <li>While the tomatoes and cheese cook, boil a large pan of water, add a couple of teaspoons of grain sea salt and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.</li>
    <li>Use the back of a spatula to scrape the crusty bits from the bottom of the pan and gently squash the tomatoes and cheese so you have a rough sauce. Taste and add more salt, pepper and some red wine vinegar. The vinegar really lifts things. Add it gradually, tasting as you go.</li>
    <li>Use a slotted spoon to scoop pasta straight into the pan of tomatoes and cheese. If some water is clinging to the pasta that is great as it will help make the sauce more creamy (trust me). Stir everything together so that the sauce coats the pasta. Taste again and add salt and pepper and vinegar as needed.</li>
    <li>Stir some rocket through the pasta and serve with a sprinkle of the raw cheese on top.</li>
