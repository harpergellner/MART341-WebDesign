My experience with HTML has been good, we did some site navigation last week so I was able to quickly do that, however working with the nav element was something that took me a little bit to figure out. 
I am excited about all of the styling tools,  but especially styling lists and images. I feel that this will help to make the website look more organized while also adding some color and excitement.
When I get faced with a challenge, I will look at the walkthrough of you explaining everything, as well as refer back to the website for help throughout.
