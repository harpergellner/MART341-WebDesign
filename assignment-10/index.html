        <strong>Mullet</strong> The traditional mullet is defined by long hair all over with a longer style in the back. The modern mullet is a short haircut with taper faded sides, short hair in the front, and longer hair in the back. This hairstyle has actually recently made a comeback in the 2000's.

    <strong>Perm</strong> The perm look in the '80s was all about the extra volume, curly bangs, tight coils, and lots and lots and lots of hairspray. Hair was meant to reach record-breaking heights back then, so frizzy texture with lots of back combing was the look du jour.
