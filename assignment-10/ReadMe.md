Universal selector type is the broadest type, used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is the star often used in a omputer schence to mean "all". While element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name (the reserved keyword placed in the opening tag of an element). Class selector is used to assign HTML elements via the class="" attribute can also be used to style elements. To select class elements, prepend a dot (.) to the front of the class name in the CSS. Lastly, ID selector, like the class selector, allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. ID names are prepared with a number sign.
The colors I chose were an aqua blue, purple and light grey because these were popular colors in the 80's. Blue being rgb(86, 178, 214); Purple being rgb(136, 48, 132); and grey only being "lightgrey".
I did not have any challenges this assignment, but I did enjoy learning and using "style.css" I thought it was cool how the colors and borders were translated onto the index.html file.
