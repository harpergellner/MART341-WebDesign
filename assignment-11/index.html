            When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of
         it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the
         head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it.
         Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil. She had what the
         Victorians would call finely shaped head. You could imagine the
         skull quite easily.
 
         I’d know her head anywhere.
 
        </div>
        <div class="second-paragraph">
            And what’s inside it. I think of that too: her mind. Her brain, all
         those coils, and her thoughts shuttling through those coils like fast,
         frantic centipedes. Like a child, I picture opening her skull, unspooling
         her brain and sifting through it, trying to catch and pin down
         her thoughts. What are you thinking, Amy? The question I’ve asked
         most often during our marriage, if not out loud, if not to the person
         who could answer. I suppose these questions stormcloud over every
         marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? Who are
         you? What have we done to each other? What will we do?

            My eyes flipped open at exactly six a.m. This was no avian fluttering
         of the lashes, no gentle blink toward consciousness. The awakening
         was mechanical. A spooky ventriloquist- dummy click of the lids:
         The world is black and then, showtime! 6- 0- 0 the clock said— in my
         face, first thing I saw. 6- 0- 0. It felt different. I rarely woke at such a
         rounded time. I was a man of jagged risings: 8:43, 11:51, 9:26. My
         life was alarmless.
        </div>
        <div>
            At that exact moment, 6- 0- 0, the sun climbed over the skyline of
         oaks, revealing its full summer angry- god self. Its reflection flared
         across the river toward our house, a long, blaring finger aimed at me
         through our frail bedroom curtains. Accusing: You have been seen.
         You will be seen.
        </div>
        <div>
            I wallowed in bed, which was our New York bed in our new house,
         which we still called the new house, even though we’d been back here
         for two years. It’s a rented house right along the Mississippi River,
         a house that screams Suburban Nouveau Riche, the kind of place
         I aspired to as a kid from my split- level, shag- carpet side of town.
         The kind of house that is immediately familiar: a generically grand,
         unchallenging, new, new, new house that my wife would— and did—
         detest.

            “Should I remove my soul before I come inside?” Her first line upon
         arrival. It had been a compromise: Amy demanded we rent, not buy,
         in my little Missouri hometown, in her firm hope that we wouldn’t
         be stuck here long. But the only houses for rent were clustered in
         this failed development: a miniature ghost town of bank- owned,
         recession- busted, price- reduced mansions, a neighborhood that closed
         before it ever opened. It was a compromise, but Amy didn’t see it that
         way, not in the least. To Amy, it was a punishing whim on my part, a
         nasty, selfish twist of the knife. I would drag her, caveman- style, to a
         town she had aggressively avoided, and make her live in the kind of
         house she used to mock. I suppose it’s not a compromise if only one of
         you considers it such, but that was what our compromises tended to
         look like. One of us was always angry. Amy, usually.
