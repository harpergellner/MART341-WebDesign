System font is the default font or regular font for that specific code, Web fonts are a CSS feature that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed, meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it. Lastly, web safe fonts are fonts that are included with most operating systems, the implication of such high availability is that a designer can expect typography involving web safe fonts to appear exactly as intended to most users.
These allow you to control the look of the fonts on the web page even if the site visitor's computer doesn't have the initial font that you called for.
I had some challenges with how to download fonts, I watched the videos posted on the website and tried to work through them, so I hope I did it right!
