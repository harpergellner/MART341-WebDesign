One form that I have come across while browsing the web is the Amazon searchbox. are pages that your users request using their browser. These pages can be written using a combination of HTML, client-script, server controls, and server code and are used to collect the required information in a logical, meaningful fashion for communication and pass to another entity.
An example of a text imput is when you are checking out online, and right before you order they ask if you have a coupon. You would use text imput to apply the coupon to get a deal on your purchase. A text imput is a text box where users can type in information that is available to the browser. A selection imput is asking for text from end-users can be unpredictable, for example when you are asked in a survey if you are satisfied with the organizations work, you can select either "satisfied" or "dissatisfied". Button imputs are rendered as simple push buttons, which can be programmed to control custom functionality anywhere on a webpage as required when assigned an event handler function (typically for the click event).
My work cycle for this assignment went very well for me, I first looked at the course website and read about all of the topics for this week. whenever I was stuck I would refer back to the website and work through it. Overall index.html assignment challenged me, but I was able to get through everything and feel confident with my assignment.
