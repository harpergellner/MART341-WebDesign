                <p class="pt-3">The history of coffee is a fascinating story. The bean has traveled 
            the globe for centuries, being smuggled out of strict countries, stolen from royalty and has 
            changed entire nations and economies. It’s remarkable how one small bean taken from tiny trees 
            in Ethiopia could become the 2nd largest commodity traded in the world today. The story goes that 
            that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, 
            his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.

            Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the 
            berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot 
            shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing 
            berries began to spread. As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began 
            a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.

        <p class="pt-3">
            Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula.  By the 15th century, coffee was being 
            grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, 
            and Turkey. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses — called 
            qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee 
            houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity. Not only did the 
            patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also listened to music, watched performers, 
            played chess and kept current on the news.  Coffee houses quickly became such an important center 
            for the exchange of information that they were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise. ”With thousands 
            of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby” began to spread.
