                <p><strong>Coffee</strong> Founded in the 15th century. The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as 
                    the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in 
                    Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.]</p>

                <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. 
                    When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, 
                    and dried.[3] Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the 
                    desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
                    Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine 
                    content.[4] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[5] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of 
                    ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although 
                    chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. 
                    It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts.</p>

                <h4>Hot Coffee</h4>
                <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia 
                    in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar 
                    to how it is now prepared for drinking.]</p>

                <p>The strength – i.e. caffeine content – of any coffee will depend on how you’ve brewed it, and how much of it you’ve got in the cup.
                    This makes for a very uneven way to measure caffeine, since you can get different results from different brewing methods.
                    Overall though, cold brew coffee seems to have higher caffeine contents than hot brew (2).
                    You’ll also notice this in Starbucks’ top caffeinated drinks, where the top of the list is crowded with cold brew and nitro brew.
                    This high caffeine content might be a result of the very long steep time cold brew requires (several hours), paired with the fact 
                    that letting the coffee steep for so long dues not ruin the flavor so most folks don’t mind.
                    Another thing to keep in mind is that what type of coffee bean you use will always have a big impact on how strong your coffee ends 
                    up, in terms of caffeine.
                    Robusta beans are the strongest beans, with half as much caffeine than Arabica. So brewing two coffees the exact same ways, only one 
                    of Robusta and one is Arabica will end up with Robusta winning the race.
                    So to answer whether hot coffee is stronger than iced coffee, it depends. If you’re having iced coffee made from cold brew coffee, 
                    then yes it almost always will be stronger in terms of caffeine.
                    If you’re having iced coffee made from hot brewed and then chilled coffee, there might not be any significant difference.</p>

                <h4>Iced Coffee</h4>
                <p>One thing you’ll often notice is that iced coffee tends to come in larger servings. As in, ordering an iced coffee to go usually results 
                    in a drink anywhere from 8 to 16 oz cups (236 ml to 473).
                    Granted part if it might be ice cubes, but that’s a big serving of coffee. And depending on how your iced coffee was brewed, it may have 
                    more or less caffeine. I’ll get to that in a minute, don’t worry.
                    As for hot brewed coffee, and keep in mind I’m comparing just black coffee here, is often served in much smaller cups. Like an espresso shot, 
                    or something under 5 oz/150 ml generally.
                    Maybe it’s because iced coffee is more of a summery drink, and just sounds like something most folks would just love to sip on during a hot July 
                    afternoon, or maybe it’s a habit thing, I’m not sure.
                    But if you look at any coffee shop, you’ll notice this difference.
                    Why does this matter ? Well, for one thing if you’re someone who likes to drink large quantities of coffee then this might be something to remember next time you order coffee.
                    And also if you’re trying to put a limit on your caffeine intake, then hot brew might just be for you since it seems to have less than iced coffee.</p>

                <p>This may or may not matter for some folks, but iced coffee might take longer to brew than hot coffee.
                    Cold brewing, which seems to be the best way to make iced coffee, can take anywhere from 8 hours to 18 hours, depending on how much time you can 
                    wait and how strong you want the flavor to be.
                    If you were to make iced coffee out of hot brewed coffee that was then chilled, it’d still take longer to put on the counter since you 
                    have to allow those extra minutes for it to cool off.
                    So if you’re on the run and really need a coffee right not, then hot brew is the quickest way to caffeine.</p>
