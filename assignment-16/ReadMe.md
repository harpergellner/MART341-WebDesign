I did not learn anything new about web development this week, I created this web page by all of the prior knowledge I have accumulated over the course of this semester to finish!
I also did not lear anything new about web design, I created this web page by all of the prior knowledge you have taught me oer the course of the semester on this project. 
I did not have any challenges on this final assignment, I am hoping that the bootstrap and fonts page display correctly for you! Thank you for a great semester.
