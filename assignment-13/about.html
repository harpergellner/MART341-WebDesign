            Brad Bird’s highly anticipated second effort for Pixar, Ratatouille opened wide on June 29, 2007. 
            The eighth feature film from Pixar, the industry’s leading computer animation studio, was immediately 
            embraced by kids, parents and moviegoers alike as one of the best films of the year. While the film delivered 
            everything the fans were waiting for, there was something else they got, something many film critics picked up
            on immediately. That Pixar’s Ratatouille, like the tale of artistry it tells, produces great art in unexpected places.

            With a premise that often defies convention, Ratatouille tells the tale of a full-grown rat named Remy whose passions
            in life take him from his family’s home in the French countryside to the kitchen of a fine Parisian restaurant where 
            he becomes, of all things, a Master Chef. As unusual a setup as having a rat prepare food might seem, under director/writer 
            Brad Bird’s care, the film moves with real conviction and contains something rather innovative -- a screenplay that blends
            live-action storytelling and animated characters.

            Although the effect seems inconspicuous, this type of narrative is something brand new in animation. It discards worn out 
            plot lines that talk down to kids and characters created solely for merchandising appeal to entertain for the sake of telling 
            a fully realized story. Bird’s hybrid of cinema and cartoon links the sentient believability of children’s author E.B. White's 
            conversations between people and small creatures to the smart humor found in one of director/writer Billy Wilder's comedies. 
            It is as much a step forward for animated features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was some 70 years ago when Walt Disney 
            first combined the illustrated depth of European children’s books to a feature film format.

            The credit for the film’s success was a multi-layered undertaking. Pixar is a studio of many talents artists. One of which, 
            Jan Pinkava, who wrote and directed Pixar’s Academy Award® winning short Geri's Game, came up with the original idea for Ratatouille. 
            It was later altered and refined when Brad Bird took over the writing and direction of the picture. Bird, who has earned a valued reputation 
            in Hollywood, is as much an artist in the kitchen of writing and direction as his cinematic doppelgänger Remy is a Master Chef in Gusteau’s 
            restaurant. His intuitive sense of character and story development can be felt on projects as varied as television’s longest running show The 
            Simpsons to fan favorite The Iron Giant and the Academy-Award® winning film The Incredibles.

            Ratatouille also excels in the area of color and design. Like all the Pixar films before it, it avoids the overtly saturated and segregated coloring, 
            or unnaturally elastic character movements sometimes associated with computer-animated films, and instead boasts a visual look that resembles a well-photographed 
            live action-film. This approach to make the appearance of the film look like it was photographed by a cinematographer rather than colored by someone filling in 
            shapes with a Wacom tablet and pen is key to final aesthetic in Ratatouille. It adds a layer of believability, a greater sense of gravity to the situations scripted 
            in the film.Getting to that point starts at the beginning of the filmmaking process while the characters and their environments are being conceived. It is a huge 
            collaborative effort where the film’s production designer Harley Jessup and many other artists experiment with designs and color by creating both hand-made and 
            computerized concept art. Jessup and the film’s director of photography/lighting Sharon Calahan also meet regularly to set goals for the look of the film. They draw 
            inspiration from a number of sources that include the art direction and cinematography of other films, but ultimately consider many variables when creating a visual style. 
            The final choices they make go on to define the personality of the characters and where they live, but primarily, create aesthetics that are both fun to look at and help advance the story.
