                With its summery combination of aubergines, courgettes, peppers and tomatoes, ratatouille is a beloved
                classic of southern French cuisine, particularly in Nice. But this simple, seasonal stew is more complex 
                than it may seem at first glance. For one thing, its core ingredients aren’t native to the area. Despite 
                today’s association between tomatoes and the Mediterranean, these New World fruits only arrived in Europe 
                at the beginning of the 16th Century. And moreover, they remained purely ornamental for nearly two centuries.

                Tomatoes aren’t the only New World ingredient to find their way into this classic French dish. Courgettes and peppers, 
                too, came to Europe from the Americas. Aubergines, meanwhile, arrived by way of India in the 16th Century. Then white and 
                round – thus resembling the “eggs” that give them their American name, eggplant – aubergines were also seen as purely 
                ornamental for quite some time. Until they were considered fit for human consumption, “there couldn’t be ratatouille,” said Benvenuto.

                First, each vegetable must be perfectly cut into pieces. While some opt for more rustic half-moons or slices, Niçoise chef Julia Sedefdjian, 
                the youngest Michelin-starred female chef in France, prefers a precise dice. “They have to be perfect squares: not too big, not too small,” 
                she said. “You want them to melt, but also to be able to recognise each vegetable in the finished dish.” For this to occur, each vegetable 
                must be fried separately in olive oil before being simmered in a tomato- and onion-based sauce. Cooking the vegetables separately ensures that 
                “each will taste truly of itself,” said the late chef Joël Robuchon.

                When this technique is embraced, ratatouille is enjoyed by all walks of life, from humble country farmers to culinary connoisseurs at Michelin-starred 
                tables. “It’s a convivial, family dish,” Sedefdjian said. “But you can rethink it so that it’s a little bit more refined.” At her Parisian restaurant 
                Baieta, she serves it as an appetiser topped with confit octopus.But while Sedefdjian is certainly doing ratatouille justice, the same cannot be said for all chefs. 
                “Often, ratatouille can be a sad and watery afterthought, plopped next to a protein like chicken, beef or lamb,” said Rosa Jackson, founder of Les Petits Farcis culinary 
                school in Nice, who teaches ratatouille as part of her Best of Nice series, now online. Cooks often opt for the wrong variety of vegetable, for example, choosing watery 
                supermarket courgette instead of the Niçois “trompette” variety so beloved locally for its nutty aroma, or chucking all of the vegetables into a slow cooker instead of 
                frying them individually. “It’s a really simple dish,” Sedefdjian said, “but frankly, there aren’t a lot of people making it well. If it’s poorly seasoned, if it’s poorly 
                cooked, really, a ratatouille can be rubbish.”

                First, prepare the vegetables: Slice the onions. Cut the aubergines into 1cm rounds. Stick them lightly with the point of a knife, sprinkle with salt to help them release 
                their liquid and set aside. Dunk the tomatoes in boiling water for 30 seconds, then peel and crush with a fork. Remove the seeds from the peppers and cut into 1cm strips. 
                Cut the courgettes into rounds about 1cm thick. Peel the garlic and slice very thinly. In a large cast iron pot, cook the onion in olive oil seasoned with the anchovy paste. 
                Add a sprig of thyme and season with pepper. Stir with a wooden spoon. As soon as the onion starts to turn golden but before it browns, add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, 
                parsley, saffron, clove-stuck onion (if using) and a sugar cube to reduce the acidity of the tomato. In one or several pans, separately fry the aubergines (10 minutes), 
                peppers (10 minutes) and courgettes (5 minutes) in olive oil, removing each vegetable and setting aside before moving on to the next. Season with salt and pepper and 
                remove any excess oil by draining each vegetable on paper towels before transferring to the tomato sauce. Cover the pot of vegetables and tomato sauce with parchment 
                paper and then the lid of the pot. Simmer 40 to 45 minutes, preferably in an oven at between 150° and 180° C. Remove the clove-stuck onion, and season to taste. 
                Add olives and a touch of basil (if using) just before serving.
